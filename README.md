# Explore-U.S-Bikeshare-Analysis
In This Dataset I'm going to analyze the most famous bikeshare systems in the united states to determine the behaviour of bikers and drive bussiness decisions
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, I Performed an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. I compared the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC.  there are differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.
